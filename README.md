Niv Lab - August 2015

### Installation instructions

To get the most out of Monday’s RStan session, it would be good if you install RStan in advance on your machine. The process is OS & version specific, but the main ingredients you will need are: 

R >= 3.0.2
RStudio 
A suitable C++ compiler (on Mac it usually comes with Apple XCode)
RStan itself 

Here are the starting points for: 

Mac OSX: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Mac-OS-X-Prerequisite-Installation-Instructions
Windows: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started — read the overview and then scroll down and follow the link to install Rtools 

If everything was installed correctly, you should be able to go to
