## Quick intro to RStan
Niv Lab - August 2015

### Installation 

The installation process is OS & version specific, but the main ingredients you will need are: 

* R >= 3.0.2
* RStudio 
* A suitable C++ compiler (on Mac it usually comes with Apple XCode)
* RStan itself 

Here are the starting points for: 

* Mac OSX: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Mac-OS-X-Prerequisite-Installation-Instructions
* Windows: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started â€” read the overview and then scroll down and follow the link to install Rtools 

If everything was installed correctly, you should be able to run the '8schools_checkpoint.R' script, which will run the sampling algorithm and produce a pretty plot of your posterior (don't worry about model specifics at this point -- this is just to check that everything works).
